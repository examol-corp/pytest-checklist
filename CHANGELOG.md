## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `--checklist-infer-search-module` flag which enables proper
  resolution of the module from with the `--checklist-collect` is
  collecting from. The previous behavior was to pick the first
  matching path that happens to be in `sys.path` that contains the
  `--checklist-collect` path. If this match matches on e.g. the
  current directory but the module import path is supposed to be set
  by `PYTHONPATH` or from normal package resolution this can result in
  the module fully qualified names being prepended by prefixes that
  don't match the modules as referenced in the test suite via import.
  - Currently this flag is not turned on by default but will be in an
    upcoming MINOR release. In the next MAJOR release this behavior
    (and this flag) will be completely deprecated.
  - Emits a deprecation warning.

### Removed

- Support for Python < 3.10
